MEGA is fully accessible without prior software installs and remains the only cloud storage provider with browser-based high-performance end-to-end encryption. The only visible signs of the crypto layer operating under MEGA's hood are the entropy collection during signup, the lack of a password reset feature and the novel (and browser-specific) ways file transfers are conducted. Today, millions of business and personal users rely on MEGA to securely and reliably store and serve petabytes of data and we believe that this success is the result of MEGA's low barrier to entry to a more secure cloud.",

If MEGA does not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or such communication that it does receive does not in MEGA's sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, MEGA may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 business days provided it has no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.",
