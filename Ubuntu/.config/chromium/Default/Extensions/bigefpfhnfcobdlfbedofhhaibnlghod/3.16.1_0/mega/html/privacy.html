      <hr />
      <h2>How long we keep your information</h2>
      <p> <span class="number">8</span> <span class="text">We keep a user's data and personal information while they are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our <a href="/terms" class="clickurl">Terms</a>.</span> </p>
      <p> <span class="number">9</span> <span class="text">We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep data and information after a user's account has been suspended or terminated. In particular, we may but shall not be obliged to, keep data and information where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.

      <h2>Disclosure</h2>
      <p> <span class="number">10</span> <span class="text">A user's data is encrypted by the user before upload to our system and therefore we do not and cannot access that content unless we are provided with the decryption key. A user may give access to others by providing them with a link and decryption key and shall be responsible for their compliance with this Policy.</span> </p>
      <p> <span class="number">11</span> <span class="text">If we think it is necessary or we have to by law in any jurisdiction then we are entitled to give a user's information to competent authorities. We reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents. We also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties. We may disclose a user's information to enforce or apply our Terms or any other agreement we have with that user; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services and the website.  For more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our <a href="/takedown" class="clickurl">Takedown Guidance Policy</a>.</span></p>
      <p> <span class="number">12</span> <span class="text">The contract a user has for our services is with Mega Limited but those services (including payment and personal data processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities and by authorised resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.  Each user authorises Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities and resellers to share and store that user's personal information among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.</span> </p>
      <p> <span class="number">13</span> <span class="text">Other than as set out above, we will not sell or otherwise provide users' personal information to a third party, or make any other use of personal information for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.</span> </p>
      <p> <span class="number">14</span> <span class="text">We strongly urge users to use best practices for ensuring the safety of their systems and devices (e.g. via security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).  Mega will never send an email asking for a user's password or suggesting that a user click a link to login to his or her account, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us. We cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to a user's computer over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access. Also, if a user loses or otherwise allows access to their encryption keys, the user will lose the security of their data. In addition if a user misplaces or forgets their encryption keys we have no ability to recover them and all access to data will be lost.</span> </p>

      <p> <span class="number">16</span> <span class="text">If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so a user can opt out of further receipt. We will abide by any e-mail unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for billing, security or other service provider purposes).</span> </p>
